<p>Here at the IPHI, we care about <i>humanity</i>. Using the latest developments from Aimoto technologies, we bring you one step closer to perfection.

<p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;"><i>About us</i>
<p>The Institute for the Preservation of Human Intelligence was founded in 1990, led by a group of engingeering and computer science graduates at the University of Iwatori. Spearheading this project were Rinto Aimoto and Takeshi Fujimori. Mr. Fujimori continues to serve on the board of directors. Mr. Aimoto left the institute's leadership in 2001, following the death of his daughter; however, his company remains the provider of the institute's robotics.<br>
Although the company has faced many changes, the original principle stands strong: As humans, we are free to change ourselves, so we therefore should. The IPHI has provided the bodies used by celebreties, athletes, and ordinary people like you for 41 years, and we are continuing to improve our products.</p>
